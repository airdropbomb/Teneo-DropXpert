## üö® Attention Before Running Teneo Cli Version

I am not `responsible` for the possibility of an account being `banned`, due to running node in the CLI, because Officially `Teneo Node Beta` does not provide an option for the CLI version, only with the Chrome extension.
but `I think` there is no reason to ban the account, because this is not cheating, I didn't change anything in the script (Heartbeats 15 minutes, maximum teneo points 25, maximum points per day 2400)
